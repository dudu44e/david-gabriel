In this project i have built an assembler for assembly language in C programing language. this program was coded in ubuntu via virtual machine. main features are:

checking syntax
alerting user for errors
printing in which line there is an error
creating three files if everything is ok with the code: entry file, extern file and object file( in hexadecimal code)
